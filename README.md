# PayTab

Welcome to the PayTab project! This project aims to replicate the basic functionality of PayTM, allowing users to perform transactions, view their account balance, and interact with other users.

## Features

- User Authentication & Authorization using JWT
- View Account Balance
- Search and view other users
- Send money to other users' accounts

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Database Transactions

The PayTab implements MongoDB Transactions to ensure data consistency and reliability. Transactions follow the ACID properties of databases, ensuring that transactions are either fully completed and committed or reverted back in case of issues, thus preventing inconsistencies in the database.
